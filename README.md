#**VBA-Challenge**
This project analyzed stock market data for three years(2018, 2019, 2020) using VBA. The goal is to create a script that will loop through all the stocks for one year at a time for each run. From the data given, the following information were derived:

1.The ticker symbol.
2.Yearly change from opening price at the beginning of a given year to the closing price at the end of that year.
3.The percent change from opening price at the beginning of a given year to the closing price at the end of that year.
4.The total stock volume of a particular stock.
5.Greatest % increase
6.Greatest % decrease
7.Greatest Total volume

Conditional formatting was also done for yearly change and percent change.

The VBA-challenge has VBA code and 3 snapshot photos of the results on the excel file after executing the code.
