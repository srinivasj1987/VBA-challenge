# **VBA-Challenge**
This project analyzed stock market data for three years(2018, 2019, 2020) using VBA. The goal is to create a script that will loop through all the stocks for one year at a time for each run. From the data give, the following information must be derived:

The ticker symbol.
Yearly change from opening price at the beginning of a given year to the closing price at the end of that year.
The percent change from opening price at the beginning of a given year to the closing price at the end of that year.
The total stock volume of a particular stock.

##**About the Script**
You can find the script inside the VBAStocks folder of this repository. The script file is called Multiple_year_stock_data_KM.xlsm.

##**Sample Output**
After the script has completed, go to the Excel workbook, and you should see the results of the script.

Here are screenshots of what the output looks like when I ran the scripts on my computer. These screenshots are also available in the VBAStocks/screenshots folder of this repository.
