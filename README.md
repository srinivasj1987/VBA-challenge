#**VBA-Challenge**
<This project analyzed stock market data for three years(2018, 2019, 2020) using VBA. The goal is to create a script that will loop through all the stocks for one year at a time for each run. From the data give, the following information must be derived:

The ticker symbol.
Yearly change from opening price at the beginning of a given year to the closing price at the end of that year.
The percent change from opening price at the beginning of a given year to the closing price at the end of that year.
The total stock volume of a particular stock.>

Since the table given is very large and it takes time for VBA to run the code in the excel file. An another excel file "alphabetical_testing.xlsx" was provided that contains lesser data was provided on which the code could be written and executed without any issues.

##**About the Script**
<You can find the script inside the VBAStocks folder of this repository. The script file is called Multiple_year_stock_data_SJ.xlsm.>

##**Sample Output**
<After the script was completed, when you go to the Excel workbook, and you should see the results of the script.

The VBA code has been uploaded in the github under the name 
Here are screenshots of what the output looks like when I ran the scripts on my computer. These screenshots are also available in the VBAStocks/screenshots folder of this repository.>
